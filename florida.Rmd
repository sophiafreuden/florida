# So if you get weird errors (like gdal error 4 or a file corruption error) it probably means your file has been corrupted. Redownload it and also keep it with the other GIS files it came with (.shx, .dbf, etc.)

# Don't be afraid to print fl and see what's inside! It will make your life easier.

# The colors are horrible if you fill by name, just FYI. Honestly not that helpful to fill by county name.
